Problem solving capabilities - from understanding a problem to writing its solution.

Think big.

The most difficult part of coding is building the resilience to come back everyday after failure. When I say failure, I mean the aspect of coding where you are debugging your code more than you are actually writing it. That is simply a part of the process.

Building a problem-solving, analytical, and critical-thinking approach are all skills that you can build. Since coding is made up of all those skills, it is something that you _can_ get better at - with time, dedication, and practice.

An underrated skill that not many people are aware that all coders posses - is that they don't know a lot of the things a lot of the time. You are bound to be in the dark, and in those moments its up to you to simply push through the uncertainty.

# Algorithm and Program

"An application consists of simply the steps (machine independent) needed to be followed in some order to solve a problem where as a program is a precise sequence of instructions to put an algorithm into practice "
-> list out some examples to make it even more clear

"Programming is important to automate, collect, manage, calculate, and analyze the process of data and information correctly"

# Programming Languages

"Programming language is a set of rules that provides a way of telling the computer what operations to perform. It provides a linguistic framework for describing computation"

Just like any language in the world, programming languages have their own volcaublary, symbols, and grammatical structure/syntax

## Levels of Programming Languages

### Machine Language

### Assembly Language

### High-Level Languages
