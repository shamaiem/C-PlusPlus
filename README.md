# C++

A 'Getting Started with C++' guide - includes explanations and example codes for Programming Fundamentals, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures

If you are new to coding, and are just starting out, we recommend you to begin with the folder of Introduction to Programming, Programming Fundamentals (PF), Object Oriented Programming (OOP), then finally Data Structures (DS)

There are additional practice questions and resources spread throughout each topic in this repository. We recommend you to download the codes individually as you go along - play around with them, change aspects of the code and try to predict the output, compare it to the actual output you get.

# How you can run a C++ code on your respective machine:

## Running C++ on Linux

## Running C++ on Windows

## Running C++ on MacOS
